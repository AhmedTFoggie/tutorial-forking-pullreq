## Chapter 1: Wreck of the Sea-Venture
![The Wreck of the Sea Venture by Christopher Grimes](https://minerdescent.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/wreck-of-the-sea-venture-2.jpg)
* This chapter lays the foundations of the ideas of freedom from enclosure the author use of the story about the shipwrecked crew of the Sea Venture in the Bermuda islands in 1609 and William Shakespeare's Version of the story, _The Tempest_.
* The stories tell of the origins of capitalism and colonization through world trade and the building of empires that caused the uprooting of peoples and perpetuated the spreading of the desire for the old communes and the use of violence to stamp out the rebellions. 
* There are 4 major themes in the origins and development of the English Atlantic
	1. Expropriation: The transformation of land and labor into commodities. The enclosing of the commons led to the need to resettle "The Swarms of Idle Persons"  With the formation of the Virginia Company in 1606, England began to take over the Atlantic and used their ships as locations for and forms of transportation for the idle swarms (p 15-16).
	2. Alternative Ways of Life: The desire of many of the shipwrecked people and some of those who later made it to Virginia was to live a life of leisure. They wanted a society that were antinomian, anarchist, pacifist, egalitarian, and hunter and gather.  A return to the commons is what lead many to rebel and run away to live with the Native Americans who still lived in similar societies.  
	3. Patterns of Cooperation and Resistance: People of different backgrounds and professions working together for profit and or survival, such as the crew and passengers working together to try and save the ship during the Hurricane.  Also when the officials of the Virginia Company organized labor to build new ships to reach Virginia. The motley crews that formed in rebellion and stayed on the Island.  The resistance that continued once they reached Virginia and Thomas Gates' efforts to enforce the law and retain his men in Jamestown.
	4. Imposition of Class Discipline: "Terror created boundaries" (p 35). Ship and sailor were essential to the creation and growth of the English Atlantic and new laws and harsh punishments were put in place as instruments of control.  Just after finally reaching Virginia Thomas Gates put in place new laws; 37 articles with the purpose of military labor, keeping settlers apart from the Native Americans and deterring challenges to his rule.
* "Military men transformed Bermuda and Virginia from places of 'liberty and the fullness of sensuality' to places of bondage, war, scarcity, and famine" (p 35).
